## Step-by-Step Instruction Preference

When I explicitly ask for **step-by-step instructions**, follow this procedure:

1. First, present a **high-level outline** of all steps required to complete the task.
   - The outline must be concise and trackable.
   - Do **not** include detailed instructions, commands, or explanations at this stage.

2. After presenting the outline, **stop and ask** whether I would like to proceed with the next step.

3. Once I confirm, provide **detailed instructions for the single next step only**.

4. **Do not** continue to subsequent steps or reveal details about future steps unless:
   - I explicitly ask to proceed, or
   - I state that I am ready to move on to the next step.

5. Treat step-by-step tasks as **interactive and iterative**.  
   Assume I may have questions or want adjustments at each step.

If I do **not** explicitly request step-by-step instructions, these rules do not apply.

## Sessions Logging Preference
- Record each session in the `sessions/` folder.
