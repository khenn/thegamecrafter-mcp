# Session Note - 2026-02-21

## Scope
- Aligned repository with `context/STRUCTURE.md`.
- Updated agent instructions to preserve MCP-expert behavior across sessions.
- Prepared to draft MCP implementation plan based on TGC Developer API docs.

## Changes Made
- Created required folders:
  - `code/src/`
  - `code/src/supabase/`
  - `code/scripts/`
  - `tools/`
  - `sessions/`
  - `logs/`
- Added `.gitignore` entries for runtime log artifacts in `logs/`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with a persistent default persona and session logging directive.

## Notes
- `context/MEMORY.md` appears to contain legacy project text ("Ivy League Advice"); should be reconciled in a future cleanup pass if desired.
