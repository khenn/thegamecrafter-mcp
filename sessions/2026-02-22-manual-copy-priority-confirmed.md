# Session: Manual Reconstruction Priority Confirmed

## Date
- 2026-02-22

## Decision
- For the ZCH copy subproject, prioritize manual game reconstruction via primitive MCP tools.
- Defer native `tgc_game_copy` implementation/use to later benchmarking.

## Why
- Goal is to prove MCP primitives can build a new game end-to-end from existing game inputs.
- This validates true build capability rather than depending on a single convenience endpoint.
