  - replaced Codex-only framing with generic MCP-capable LLM client/runtime requirement.
  - kept Codex CLI as recommended (not mandatory) with tested version note.
  - added hyperlink to The Game Crafter site.
  - added hyperlink to TGC API key creation page.
- Added compatibility note under MCP section:
  - explicit instructions are provided for Codex and Claude.
  - guidance is adaptable to Gemini/other MCP-capable LLM clients.
