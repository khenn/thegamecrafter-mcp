# Session: Public README Installation Guide

Date: 2026-02-23

## Goal
Create a comprehensive setup guide for external users with limited MCP/skill experience.

## Output
- Added top-level `README.md` with:
  - prerequisites
  - clone/build steps
  - environment variable setup
  - MCP install instructions (Codex + generic stdio client)
  - public AGENT/skill install in a separate consumer workspace
  - smoke tests and troubleshooting
  - LLM-driven auto-setup prompt block
  - security notes around credential handling

## Notes
- Documentation is written to be both human-readable and automation-friendly for LLM-assisted setup.
