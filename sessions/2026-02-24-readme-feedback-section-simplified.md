# Session: README Feedback Section Simplified

Date: 2026-02-24

## Objective
Reduce README detail for feedback workflow to user-facing summary only.

## Change
- Rewrote README feedback section to remove low-level decision/workflow internals.
- Kept only:
  - high-level behavior,
  - opt-out location (`preferences.feedback_contribution` in `AGENTS.md`),
  - automatic issue publishing summary,
  - fallback behavior and user expectation for manual issue submission.
