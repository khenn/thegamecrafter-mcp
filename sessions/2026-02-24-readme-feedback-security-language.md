# Session: README Feedback Security Language

Date: 2026-02-24

## Objective
Strengthen README wording so users clearly understand privacy/security protections and publication approval controls for feedback contribution.

## Changes
- Updated `README.md` feedback section to emphasize:
  - strict scope to reusable TGC interface learnings,
  - exclusion of user IP/game specifics, PII, secrets, session identifiers, and local machine details,
  - anonymization/generalization when context is needed,
  - explicit per-publication user control (approve/reject after seeing exact text).
