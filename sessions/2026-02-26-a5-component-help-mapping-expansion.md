# Session Note - 2026-02-26 - A5 Component Help Mapping Expansion

## Summary
Expanded component-family Help Center mappings so all implemented families have direct or nearest-relevant help references in `component-profiles.md`.

## Updated
- `skills/tgc-guided-workflows/references/component-profiles.md`
  - added missing help links for:
    - `MediumCoilBook`
    - `MediumScorePadColor` related template help
    - `MediumGameMat`
    - `CustomSmallSticker`
    - `CustomSmallPunchout`
    - `SmallDualLayerBoard` related punchout guidance
    - `AcrylicShape125`
    - `CustomColorD4/D6/D8`
    - `CustomPrintedMeeple`

## Roadmap
- Marked A5 sub-item complete:
  - "Expand curated guidance coverage across all implemented component families."

## Notes
- Some component identities do not have a single perfect article match in the selected Help Center categories.
- In those cases, nearest authoritative guidance links were added explicitly.
