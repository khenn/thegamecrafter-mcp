# Session: Add A5 Skill Best-Practices Roadmap Item

Date: 2026-02-28

## Change
Added a new Goal A5 roadmap item to evaluate and restructure skills for OpenAI skills best-practice alignment.

## Added Scope
- Single-job skill focus
- Instruction-first approach (scripts only when deterministic behavior is required)
- Imperative steps with explicit inputs/outputs
- Trigger-behavior prompt testing
- Context-minimizing skill split/reference loading so only component-relevant context is loaded per task

## Reason
Ensure future skill growth remains accurate, maintainable, and context-efficient as component coverage expands.
