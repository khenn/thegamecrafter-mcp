For more information, please see our intellectual property policy. The first
- **How do I just make one custom-printed item (not a game)?**: Think of a "game" more like a basket where you tell our system what you want to be sent to you. What you add to that game does not need to be a full game you can just add 1 card and we will send you that 1 card if you order that game. We would recommend that you start by reading through the "Getting Started" section of our website, as it contains a lot of great information about our products and services, as well as information about how you can use our website to create your game.

- **How much will my game cost?**: The best way to find the cost of custom printed components for your game would be to build a quote in our system. 1. First, click on "Make" at the top of the screen. Then, select "Pricing" from the drop-down list. 2. Next, click on "Build a Quote."
- **How to make a Card Game / Tarot Deck**: You can watch a tutorial about how to download templates for your game here: https://youtu.be/VggD1_mTlmY You can watch a tutorial about how to design images using our templates here: https://youtu.be/8IDecwxMakY You can watch a tutorial about how to load your images into a game here: https://youtu.be/fFQcLH5yTiE You can watch a tutorial about how to order your game here: https://youtu.be/ual0FnfQcMI ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **How to Order Your Game**: After you have put all the work into loading your images into your game and proofing them , you will want to order a copy of your game. Many designers want to order multiple copies of their game. Please order only one copy of your game and check it carefully for any errors, omissions, or changes that need to be made before ordering multiple copies of your game or publishing your game. This will save you time, money and stress down the road. -------------------------------------------------------
- **Intellectual Property**: We want you to know that your intellectual property is protected when you use The Game Crafter. When you upload a game to The Game Crafter, you still retain all rights to the game. We do not assume your copyrights or trademarks. The Game Crafter is not mentioned in your game components unless you put it in there yourself. Absolutely! You can choose to sell your game, however (and wherever) you like.
- **What does it mean to "Publish" my game?**: When you publish your game with The Game Crafter, your game becomes available (and searchable) in our Shop for purchase by other customers.

You can find more information about how to publish your game at https://help.thegamecrafter.com/article/109-p

When the game is ready the designer can purchase 1 copy or as many as they'd like and The Game Crafter prints and ships the game. Since we are a print on demand game publisher, there a
- **Who is TGC for?**: The reality is that most games will never sell 10,000 units. Unfortunately, traditional production runs require you to buy 5,000 - 20,000 units to make production cheap enough to be profitable. At The Game Crafter (TGC), even if your game only sells one copy, you'll have made a profit! Try to beat that by negotiating with publishers, distributors, retailers, and manufacturers. Even if you are an established game developer, making prototypes for play-testing can be time-consuming and costly. Some

### Frequently Asked Questions
- **Can I buy some of the components of my game instead of having to buy the whole game?**: Yes. The easiest thing to do would be to create a copy of your game, delete any pieces you don't need, then place an order for the copy. To create a copy of your game, click on "Games", click on "Edit" next to your game, then click on "Copy" in the Manage section.
- **Can I make an adult-themed game?**: Yes. We generally don't censor content, but do have a couple of rules for adult-themed games: 1) They can't contain anything illegal. 2) If they are made available for sale on our site, there can be no nudity or explicit language on the game's Shop page, and the game should be clearly identified as intended for a mature audience ages 18+. 3) If your game contains photos of people, you should provide the permission/license to use the photos to customer support prior to ordering. For more informat
- **Can I make games for kids?**: Although we'd love to allow you, our valued authors, to publish games for children under the age of 14, an Act of Congress prevents us from allowing it. The Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) requires that all products manufactured for children under the age of 14 be tested by an independent third party. This testing costs several thousand dollars per product, and is therefore not something we can realistically provide. While we think that it's important to protect children from ch

- **Why has my "Estimated Ship Date" changed?**: You may have noticed a change to your "Estimated Ship Date" and this is quite common.

In some cases, we're able to deliver orders quicker and other times we may run into delays that cause your ship date to be pushed back. Watch the video below to learn more about how our production process works and the tools available to check the status of your order. Here a

### File Preparation
- **3D Viewer**: The 3D viewer allows you to see a 3D rendering of your game components. It also allows you to see what the printing will look like with varying degrees of drift. For boxes, the viewer allows you to see what the box will look like when open and closed. For folding game boards and mats, it allows you to see what the board/mat will look like when folded and unfolded. For dials, you can use the 3D viewer to see how the print will appear on the assembled dial wheels. For custom dice, you can use the 
- **Art Resources**: We offer a department in our Shop for game design assets . You’ll find over 1000+ sets of illustrations, card designs, currency, and icons, with more being added every day. Most game design assets come in the form of sets so that you have almost everything you need to create a game. Most are sold under our standard commercial license that gives you the rights to do almost anything you want with the assets, except resell them yourself. This gives you the flexibility to use the images to build you
- **Color Profile**: Due to human perception, light levels, monitor calibration, and all sorts of printing variations (humidity, heat, age of fuser, toner changes, etc), not to mention the difference between colors created by light and colors created by print, it is impossible to do perfect color matching from what you see on your screen to what we print. However, by using our color profile with your image editors, you'll get a little closer than you would otherwise. Download this file and use it with your image edi
- **Custom Acrylic Shapes**: Board game designers can now create their own 100% custom acrylic game pieces! In the past we’ve allowed you to make custom punchouts, stickers, cards, and other printable components all to your exact specifications. For the first time we can now do that with plastic game pieces. You’ll start with a piece of 8 inch by 4 inch or 10.5 inch x 9 inch acrylic. The 8 x 4 comes in 2 thicknesses(1/4″ or 1/8″) and over a dozen colors.
- **Custom Color Printed Dice**: Now you can make full color custom-printed D4 , D6 , and D8 dice at The Game Crafter! To do so, you'll just upload full-color images like you would with any of our other products. That said, there is a special process for printing white on the dice. You can find detailed information about how to create your dice at https://help.thegamecrafter.com/article/441-how-to-make-and-order-custom-printed-dice . **Note** It is very important it is to have a high-quality PNG image with no jpeg artifacts and
- **Custom Dice**: The Game Crafter can manufacture several types of custom dice. They are produced on demand and can be ordered in any quantity. You can find more information about Dice Stickers and how to get them here. You can use the dice stickers with our blank dice . You can find more information about Custom Printed Dice and how to get them here.
- **Custom Printed Meeples**: You can design your own full color custom printed Meeples ! These are perfect for adding extra flair to any game. Plus, you can print front and back so you can determine directionality for your Meeples. Pricing is $0.50 per Meeple base, plus $0.75 per printed side. However, if you have 6 or more Meeples in your game, the cost drops to only $0.25 per printed side. And you can choose to print only 1 side if you like. To do so, you'll just upload full-color images like you would with any of our oth
- **Custom Punchouts and Card Stock**: With custom punchouts and cardstock , you can design your own shapes to be cut. You choose the size of the slug you want to use, and then create the artwork and the cut lines! For the first time, you can have truly bespoke game pieces in a print on demand game. All custom punchouts are printed and made of 60 point (0.07 inches) thick chipboard. All custom card stock items are printed and made of 12pt 320gsm black core card stock. The slug sizes for custom punchouts are 3.25" x 5.25" for small , 
- **Custom Punchouts: Hinges**: A hinge is a tie that is meant to bend rather than separate. Hinges can be used to create 3-dimensional objects .For parts that need to bend or have a hinge, use ties that are 0.07” wide with slits that are 0.5” long and 0.07” wide. Adding more ties will yield a stronger hinge. Hinges.ai For a cleaner look, hinges or bends may be made with a straight line rather than a 0.07” rectangle. However, this will yield a weaker hinge.
- **Custom Punchouts: Screws & Dials**: Screws come as two pieces that twist together to hold 2-3 layers of chipboard. A great way to utilize these features is by creating custom dials. To create a dial, begin by downloading the printing template of the desired slug size.
- **Custom Punchouts: Standees**: Standees are harder to make than you might think. The slot that hooks the two pieces together must be very precise for them to stay connected. The slot in the bottom of the upper piece must be the same height as the remaining area below the slit on the lower piece. For a snug fit, the slots are smaller at the innermost end than they are at the opening. Our chipboard is .065" thick, so the opening of the slot should also be .065" wide. The innermost end of the slot should be .055" wide.
- **Design Tools**: We provide templates in a variety of formats, and the files can be used with the image editing programs listed below: You can find additional information about the types of software that are useful for pre-production at https://help.thegamecrafter.com/article/198-types-of-software

Watch the video below to learn what drift is, how it can make your game look bad, and how you can design your game to mitigate its effects.
- **Designing for Foil**: Foil cards can be used to great effect, whether it’s for an ultra-rare card or an entire shiny deck. You do not have to change your existing card artwork to get it in a foil version, but there are a few things to keep in mind about your card design if you want your foil cards to really stand out. Most printers, including ours, print with four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK). Our normal printers do not lay down any white, as it’s assumed that the paper being printed on is bright w
- **How do I get a UPC/ ISBN for my game?**: Many of our customers wish to sell their games in retail shops, but to do so they must have a barcode on the packaging. This is actually a relatively easy process, but if you haven’t done it before, it can feel daunting. To help you out we’ve decided to provide a quick tutorial on the process. The first step is to determine if you need a UPC (universal product code). The only reason to have it is if you plan to sell it at retailers. If you’re selling your game exclusively from our website, your

- **Color Filter**: The color filter on the Proof screen offers a representation of how the colors in your images may appear in the final print. Here’s an example of a high contrast image. Because the statue in the foreground is so dark, when it is printed, you won’t actually see most of the detail. on it. The filter gives you a heads up about it. Most images don’t have such a stark contrast. However, if you have a lot of dark elements in your images, then those will come out with more contrast on the printer. For

The process is simple, and it starts with you choosing which photo/image you want from your computer. Next, you can position and resize the image so it looks exactly how you want it. Finally, you'll choose which poker card style you want for the front of your cards. Several examples of our designs are below Click here to get started with your custom playing ca
- **Custom Printed Meeples**: You can design your own full color custom printed Meeples ! These are perfect for adding extra flair to any game. Plus, you can print front and back so you can determine directionality for your Meeples. Pricing is $0.50 per Meeple base, plus $0.75 per printed side. However, if you have 6 or more Meeples in your game, the cost drops to only $0.25 per printed side. And you can choose to print only 1 side if you like. To do so, you'll just upload full-color images like you would with any of our oth
- **Custom Punchouts and Card Stock**: With custom punchouts and cardstock , you can design your own shapes to be cut. You choose the size of the slug you want to use, and then create the artwork and the cut lines! For the first time, you can have truly bespoke game pieces in a print on demand game. All custom punchouts are printed and made of 60 point (0.07 inches) thick chipboard. All custom card stock items are printed and made of 12pt 320gsm black core card stock. The slug sizes for custom punchouts are 3.25" x 5.25" for small , 
- **Custom Punchouts: Hinges**: A hinge is a tie that is meant to bend rather than separate. Hinges can be used to create 3-dimensional objects .For parts that need to bend or have a hinge, use ties that are 0.07” wide with slits that are 0.5” long and 0.07” wide. Adding more ties will yield a stronger hinge. Hinges.ai For a cleaner look, hinges or bends may be made with a straight line rather than a 0.07” rectangle. However, this will yield a weaker hinge.
- **Custom Punchouts: Screws & Dials**: Screws come as two pieces that twist together to hold 2-3 layers of chipboard. A great way to utilize these features is by creating custom dials. To create a dial, begin by downloading the printing template of the desired slug size.
- **Custom Punchouts: Spinners**: Do you have a game idea that requires a randomizer with custom icons and a D6 just isn’t cutting it? Consider making a custom spinner! Previously, the only spinner available at the Game Crafter is an 8” mat made of cardstock. With the custom punchout option, spinners can now be made of sturdy chipboard, in many sizes and infinite shapes. Spinners come as two pieces that snap together. Our spinners are 2.73” long, making them a great size for a 3” spinner tile that can fit on the Small Punchout s
- **Custom Punchouts: Standees**: Standees are harder to make than you might think. The slot that hooks the two pieces together must be very precise for them to stay connected. The slot in the bottom of the upper piece must be the same height as the remaining area below the slit on the lower piece. For a snug fit, the slots are smaller at the innermost end than they are at the opening. Our chipboard is .065" thick, so the opening of the slot should also be .065" wide. The innermost end of the slot should be .055" wide.
- **Designing for Foil**: Foil cards can be used to great effect, whether it’s for an ultra-rare card or an entire shiny deck. You do not have to change your existing card artwork to get it in a foil version, but there are a few things to keep in mind about your card design if you want your foil cards to really stand out. Most printers, including ours, print with four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK). Our normal printers do not lay down any white, as it’s assumed that the paper being printed on is bright w
- **Download Only/Print and Play Items**: You can sell digital files on The Game Crafter. Why would you want to do that? You may want to sell a print and play version of your game.

For dials, you can use the 3D viewer to see how the print will appear on the assembled dial wheels. For custom dice, you can use the 
- **Booklets**: Our booklets are a great way to create a professional-looking set of rules for your game. They are saddle stitched, full color, and full bleed, and are available for just 20 cents per page. (A 20-page booklet takes up the thickness of 4 cards in a box.) When adding pages to your booklet, you'll create an image for each individual page. This means the first page you load will be the cover, then the next page will be page 2. Booklets can have up to 40 pages. Please note that your total page count 
- **Boxes and Other Packaging**: TGC offers a variety of custom-printed packaging options for your game: If you order more 200 or more copies of a game that is produced in a tuck box, The Game Crafter will automatically upgrade the tuck box to a thicker material (18pt card stock rather than 16pt) and apply a glossy protective coating to the box. This is something we do for free, but can only afford to do in larger batches, so that's why we don't offer it for every tuck box we produce. See your box in 3D using our 3D Box Viewer:
- **Bulk Pricing**: When ordering games for yourself, or when you use our bulk order fulfillment system , you may qualify for bulk pricing. Discounts start at 10 copies of a game (in one order) for approximately 5% off, and can go up to as much as a 35% discount at 100 copies. We also offer additional discounts for many games at 500 and 1000 copies. Each game is a little bit different. Some components have a fairly fixed cost even at large volumes, so not all games will qualify for the same discount. Please note th
- **Cards**: The Game Crafter can make 17 different sizes of cards. All cards are die-cut, have rounded corners (except for the trading card ), and are printed in full color on both sides. Standard cards are printed on 12" x 18" sheets of 12pt 320gsm black core card stock, and this gives them a nice texture and good heft. Clear cards are printed on a glossy 12pt PVC plastic. Decks of cards can contain any number of cards (up to 2000 total components per game), and they are printed at our facility in Madison,
- **Chits**: Chits are used as counters and customizable tokens in many games. Sometimes they are referred to as "punchouts". They are made of 60pt chipboard and are printed full-color and full-bleed and are double-sided. *Please be sure to indicate the quantity of tiles you wish to receive, as you will receive only as many as are indicated in the "Quantity" field next to each chit.* Note: If a component only has a quantity of 1, that means we will ship you 1 copy of that image/component (chit, card, etc...)
- **Dials**: Dials are often used as score-keeping devices or health trackers, or used as a sort of decoder ring. There are two types of dials offered: Small Dials Dual Dials
- **Dice Stickers**: Custom Dice Stickers are half inch square stickers that are used in conjunction with our blank dice . This allows game designers to create their own custom printed dice. Custom Dice Sticker image files should be 188x188 pixels. It is generally a good idea to bleed your background color over the entire square image (past the red line, all the way to the edges of the image so that there is no gray visible). In addition, even minor print/cut registration problems will be very apparent because the s
- **Game Boards**: Game Boards are often the central component in tabletop games, hence the name "board games". We offer a variety of game boards to suit your needs: Our standard sizes of game boards are listed above. However, if you need a custom size/shape game board, visit our Laboratory and they can assist you in creating a 100% custom prototype game board. Also, if you need something bigger or a special size, consider putting 2 or more boards together for a larger playing surface. Click here for game board te
- **Game Mats**: Mats are a great option for game designers who are looking for low-cost, custom-printed game components. Mats provide designers with plenty of flexibility and they are affordable because they're produced from cardstock. Mats use a 16pt cardstock that is slightly thicker than the cardstock used for our cards. All mats are printed double-sided in full color. In addition, we now offer two sizes of custom-printed neoprene mats . We do not make game mats in custom sizes. You could create a small cust
- **Going Green**: TGC is concerned about the environment, and we're working hard to reduce our footprint. Unfortunately, one-off production is far less efficient than mass production. That actually adds to our footprint, but one-off production also has some advantages:
- **Linen Texture**: When you enable linen texture on your game, all applicable items in your game from your cards to your box to your game board will get our professional linen texture. This finish is available with or without the UV coating (but the UV coating really makes it pop). **Note: Linen texture does not work well with dry erase markers, as the marker residue will get caught in the texture. You can add linen texture to your game for $.25 per component sheet. To do so, visit the Make tab in your game and en
- **Made in the USA**: The Game Crafter, LLC is located in Madison, Wisconsin (USA) and is an American company. The Game Crafter has specialized employees that print, assemble, and ship orders to customers. Note: Game pieces and parts are sourced from both domestic (US-based) and international companies. The reason for this is that there aren't many game part manufacturers available. Many game parts are only available from overseas suppliers where lower labor and manufacturing costs allow them to be profitable. The Ga
- **Play Money**: Play Money is made of 148gsm paper, and is printed double sided. Click here for play money templates and product info Please note that play money flips along the long edge during production. If you wish for both sides of the bill to be oriented in the same direction in print, you will need to rotate either the front or the back image by 180 degrees, so that the images are oriented in opposite directions in the game editor.
- **Production Queues**: We have an Urgent Queue, Normal Queue, Parts-Only Queue, and a Bulk Queue . You can learn more about our queues by listening to this podcast . You can see the status of our queues from the status page.

- **Types of Software**: This list of software tools was assembled by JT Smith and Jeff King from The Game Crafter Official Podcast . In episode 74 , they answered a listener request which asked them: "what software tools are useful for pre-production, before getting to The Game Crafter's online process?" . So JT and Jeff came up with a list of useful tools that can assist you in creating your games. If you are a new designer and not familiar with these tools, we suggest that you watch some YouTube tutorials for these p
- **Who is TGC for?**: The reality is that most games will never sell 10,000 units. Unfortunately, traditional production runs require you to buy 5,000 - 20,000 units to make production cheap enough to be profitable. At The Game Crafter (TGC), even if your game only sells one copy, you'll have made a profit! Try to beat that by negotiating with publishers, distributors, retailers, and manufacturers. Even if you are an established game developer, making prototypes for play-testing can be time-consuming and costly. Some
